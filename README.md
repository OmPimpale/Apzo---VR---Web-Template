The Apzo VR Web Template is a sleek and modern website build using basic <strong> HTML </strong> and <strong> CSS </strong>

This template is optimized for businesses showcasing their VR solutions, promoting demos, or offering services in the virtual reality space. With a professional layout and responsive design, Apzo VR ensures an impressive user experience across devices.

What I learn : 1. How to use HTML tags for creating basic structure. 2. CSS for designing the entire web page, also "Media Query" used for responsive web designing.
